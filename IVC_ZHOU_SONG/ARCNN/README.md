# Artifact Reduction CNN

pytorch based Artifact Reduction CNN. This CNN is based on Chao Dong, [et al. “Compression Artifacts Reduction by a Deep Convolutional Network.” ICCV 2015 and Pavel Svoboda](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06993.pdf) and [et al. “Compression Artifacts Removal Using Convolutional Neural Networks.” ICCV 2017 ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00366.pdf) 

## Usage

open ARCNN.ipynb with Jupyter notebook, and follow the instructions.

the classes including CNN model and dataset are in the "Functions_and_Clsses.py"

in this folder we only keep one test sequences: "foreman20_40_RGB"
